## Versions

In the process of writing the content for this book, Angular went from Alpha, to Beta and eached RC!

The book was released when Angular 2 was still in Beta version. You can find the code for the initial version of the book [here](https://github.com/mgechev/switching-to-angular2/tree/beta).

The master branch contains the changes from the latest RC.3. Note that the master branch uses the deprecated forms and router modules. Although the final APIs will be slightly different, I strongly recommend you to go through Chapters 6 and 7 in order to get the foundational idea of the underlaying concepts for these two fundamental modules.
